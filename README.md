# quasi_dictionnary

Provides functions for indexing a set of key-values elements. The query has false positives which rate is below 1/2^fingerprint_size. 
A false positive is an element not indexed for which the structures provides a value.
Note that values provided for indexed elements are correct.  

The quasi_dictionnay uses the BooPHM Minimal perfect hash function for associating a key to a value. A fingerprint value is automatically added to each indexed element for probabilistic set representation.
